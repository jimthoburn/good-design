					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>Commuting sucks. "Mega commuters" endure 90 minutes each way to punch the clock. More Americans fall into that category than there are residents of Copenhagen. Why point to that Danish city? It's got the busiest biking street in the Western world—the result of years of public pressure and infrastructure investment that reshaped commuting habits. The arguments for bike commuting are familiar: healthier for you and the environment; saves you tons of cash; often faster than driving or taking public transit. Here's another: it's an opportunity to see your city or town without looking through a pane of shatter-proof glass. Another: it's a lot of fun. In many places it can seem too dangerous to bike to work—no bike lanes and a gauntlet of taxi doors and four-wheeled aggression. A suggestion to mitigate those concerns: find at least one bike buddy. There's strength (and safety) in numbers. So go ahead and try it. This week, saddle up and ride a bike to work. It might become a habit.</p>
