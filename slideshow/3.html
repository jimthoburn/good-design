      <p>On three Thursdays over the past month—at our <a href="http://www.good.is/post/education-kickoff-event-you-re-invited/">kickoff event on August 19</a>, our <a href="http://www.good.is/post/the-good-education-series-you-re-invited/">discussion about enabling creativity on September 9</a>, and our <a href="http://www.good.is/post/the-good-education-event-series-on-content-what-question-would-you-ask/">discussion about content on September 16</a>—we've gathered to talk about ensuring that all kids are on track to receive the 21st century education they deserve.</p>

      <p>Yesterday's final panel focused on how to urge students to set high expectations for academic achievement. The panelists were: <a href="http://is.gd/fqSCd">JB Schramm</a> (College Summit), <a href="http://partners.nfte.com/about/team.asp">Estelle Reyes</a> (Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship), <a href="http://is.gd/fqSSG">Paul Miller</a> (Teach for America), and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-school-question-4zimmer3-2009mar03,0,2100787.story">Steve Zimmer</a> (Board of Education, LAUSD)</p>

      <p>Check out our slideshow of photos from last night's event. And thanks to everyone who came out for any or all of the GOOD education events. You made them a resounding success and got us really excited about the hard (but rewarding) work ahead of all of us.</p>
